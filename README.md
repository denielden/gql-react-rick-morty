## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Css Grid
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - For routes
- [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) - Data
- [Apollo client](https://www.apollographql.com/) - Client
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [React Spinners](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-spinners)

### What I learned

I had a lot of fun in this project and I was able to learn how to:
- write **GraphQL** Queries
- use and configure **Apollo client** with React

I initially had trouble understanding how to use GraphQL in components and how to pass data. I find it a bit limiting the fact of having to bind the query to a component and not being able to simply return the data.
